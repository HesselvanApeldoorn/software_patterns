For the first assignment of the Software Patterns course we have chosen the subject ``Bookflix''. This document shows the software architecture of this subject. 


The Bookflix idea is loosely based on the streaming service Netflix. Rather than offering video streams, Bookflix offers books. From the Bookflix website, customers can pick a book that they like. This book is then downloaded to their PC so that it is ready to be read. Bookflix is not only limited to book provisioning but also Newspapers and Magazines. For providing our services, premature deals have been established with a couple of book/magazine publishers and Newspapers.

Our services are provided through a dedicated website. As a start published books, newspapers and magazines are all in English which is expected to reach a broad audience. More language support will be integrated at later deployment phases.
