For the first assignment of the Software Patterns course we have chosen the subject ``Bookflix''. This document shows the software architecture of this subject. 


The Bookflix idea is loosely based on the streaming service Netflix. Rather than offering video streams, Bookflix offers books. From the Bookflix website, customers can pick a book that they like. This book is then downloaded to their PC so that it is ready to be read.
